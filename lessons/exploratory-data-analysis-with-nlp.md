# Lesson Goals

What does it mean to “explore” data? 

Exploratory data analysis refers to a category of data analysis approaches where you attempt to sort/filter/experience data in a way that guides your research process, often in the absence of a fully formed statistical model (or even hypothesis!) You may begin a research process with a promising set of data, but without a clear sense of its structure, or an understanding of whether certain kinds of analysis would yield findings relevant to a line of inquiry. 

In this lesson, we hope to prepare you to evaluate and use natural language processing methods for your data. We focus specifically on sentiment analysis techniques, while also preparing you to evaluate and learn new skills to support your exploratory data analysis process (for example, [mapping correspondence](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/using-javascript-to-create-maps) or [sonifying data](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sonification)). To accomplish this, we will focus on using **Python 3** and its standard libraries, along with **NLTK (the Natural Language Toolkit)** and **pandas**.

Our goal in this lesson are as follows: 

* To introduce readers to sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for exploring textual communication between individuals.
* To demonstrate how research questions can guide the selection and application of these techniques, e.g. selecting a technique, determining the appropriate scope of analysis, applying analysis to a network versus an individual entity, etc.
* To utilize appropriate data structures in the Python language and relevant libraries (NLTK, pandas) to analyze and transform data.

Part 1 introduces exploratory data analysis with sentiment analysis using the Enron E-mail Dataset.

Part 2 builds off of these techniques by exploring e-mail correspondence as relationships within a network. This part relies upon more intermediate-advanced level Python techniques (but we will provide guidance along the way). 


# Part 1: Using Sentiment Analysis to Explore Enron E-mails


## What Types of Questions Can Exploratory Data Analysis Help You Answer?

In 1977, mathemetician John Tukey described exploratory data analysis as a kind of detective work:

> "Unless the detective finds the clues, judge or jury has nothing to consider. Unless exploratory data analysis uncovers indications, usually quantitative ones, there is likely to be nothing for confirmation data analysis to consider." (Tukey 1977:3) 

Tukey's seminal writing on exploratory data analysis distinguishes between the work of *exploring* data and *confirming* a theory or model. For Tukey (who, among many other things, invented the box plot), analysis without the step of explorations run a great risk: "... restricting one's self to the planned analysis -- failing to accompany it with exploration -- loses sight of the most interesting results too frequently to be comfortable." (Tukey 1977:3)

Imagine that you are a researcher passionate about the way people communicate in groups. You might be a historian curious about impromptu philosophical debates in Turkish market spaces, or a cultural anthropologist interested in the social function of gossip in rural Japan. Maybe you are a sociologist interested in penpal relationships between inmates in the United States on Death Row (for more, see *Letter writing as a social practice* (Barton and Hall 2000)). 

In all three scenarios, you would likely be interested in data that represents casual communication -- letters, transcripts, or even indirect summations in journal entries. You may approach a collection of data with a plan of analysis, in which you predict how the data might prove a hypothesis or support a theory. And yet, the nuances of data that contributes most profoundly to your research questions might vary greatly - and unexpectedly. What might constitute a meaningless analytical approach for one researcher might reveal something about the heart of another’s research question. How, then, can you best calibrate your analytic approach to the questions that matter to you the most?

What we hope to provide here, in addition to a strong introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques, is a better understanding of how you can evaluate and utilize a variety of tools for the craft of exploratory data analysis -- and, as a result, to help you find the most interesting results lurking in your data.

## A Case Study: the Enron E-mail Corpus

Most citizens of the United States experienced the [Enron Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) as the largest collapse of a publicly traded company in history. In 2001, the company started showing signs of financial strain that didn't align with the company's financial disclosures to that point. The publcly traded Enron stocks dropped from their mid-2000 high of $90.75 to less than a dollar in November 2001, which led stockholders to sue the company. A subseqent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) investigation revealed that Enron executives committed fraud and accounting malpractice on a massive scale. Enron declared bankruptcy in December of that year, which was the largest bankruptcy in the United States history up to that point. In the years that followed, several executives faced criminial convictions for their role in the scandal.

But for a diverse group of researchers, the Enron Scandal meant something more:

> “One of the most infamous corporate scandals of the past few decades curiously left in its wake one of the most valuable publicly available datasets. In late 2001, the Enron Corporation’s accounting obfuscation and fraud led to the bankruptcy of the large energy company. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission subpoenaed all of Enron’s email records as part of the ensuing investigation. Over the following two years, the commission released, unreleased, and rereleased the email corpus to the public after deleting emails that contained personal information like social security numbers. The Enron corpus contains emails whose subjects range from weekend vacation planning to political strategy talking points, and it remains the only large example of real world email datasets available for research.” (Hardin, Sarkis, and Urc, 2014)

When the organized and redacted [Enron E-mail Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) was released in 2004, researchers discovered an unprecedented opportunity: direct access to the spontaneous, largely uncensored way employees in a doomed coporation communicate with one another. Suddenly, researchers had access to how people communicated at work at an unprecedented scale. This mattered for researchers interested in the special case of the Enron scandal and collapse, and also for researchers interested in a wide spectrum of questions about everyday communication at work.

In the following decade, hundreds of new studies sprouted up from the e-mails pursuing questions as diverse as social network theory, community and anomaly detection, gender and communication within organizations, behavioral change during an organizational crisis, insularity and community formation, and more.

In addition to the sheer quantity of messages included (the corpus contains over 600,000 messages), the Enron E-mail Corpus also includes the metadata necessary for researchers to pursue their research questions. Just as the presence of envelopes with legible sender and recipient addresses would be a wonderful asset for researchers of historic letter correspondences, the presence of sender and recipient e-mail addresses allows for researchers to associate e-mails with particular known individuals within the corporation. (Keep in mind that this is not a perfect process, however, such as  when the same individual has multiple email addresses, or two individuals share the same address!)

Exploratory data analysis offers us techniques that tackle both the primary data (in this case, the body text of e-mails) as well as exploring how the metadata might support additional, sometimes unexpected forms of analysis (which we explore below).

Regardless of the specifics, most studies included a number of steps to explore the structure and features of the Enron corpus data:
* Preprocessing and data cleaning, e.g. linking multiple e-mail address aliases to a single individual when applicable, adding calculated fields and values (such as gender, rank within the organization, etc.), etc.
* Analysis of message data and metadata using one or more analytical techniques, e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP), clustering, modeling, machine learning, etc.
* Representation of correspondence as occurring within a network, using network analysis, community detection, etc.
Many, but not all studies used the above steps as the foundation to identify and test a hypothesis, test out a statistical model, and so on. Alone, these steps constitute some of the core competencies of exploratory data analysis. 

In the following sections, we will focus primarily on analysis of the correspondence data using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique of Sentiment Analysis (step 2 above). By necessity however, we will engage all three competency areas – and point you to the relevant lessons on data cleaning and network analysis when you’re ready to go deeper in those areas.


## Why Sentiment Analysis?

Return for a moment to the academic personas we discussed above. What do you hope that e-mail correspondence will reveal about the individuals and community you are studying? And what is it about e-mail in particular that will contribute something distinct from other types of analysis, such as surveys, interviews, or in-person observations?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a broad term for techniques for applying computational analytical techniques writing and speech. While software and online applications typically prompt users for special forms of interaction and communication that can be easily understood by those programs, NLP includes the endeavor to understand human communication as it occurs “naturally” and spontaneously in everyday life. Typically, NLP involves selecting an analytical technique as well as a lexicon or corpus of data to “train” or calibrate that technique for type of text a user wishes to analyze. NLP provides a bridge between a collection of text - in this case, collections of e-mails for individuals working within a corporation - and subsequent analytical techniques to “make sense” of this data. 

Sentiment Analysis seeks to identify the emotions implied by words and phrases. This may help researchers link particular topics to emotions in order to identify individual opinions and feelings about those topics. Sentiment analysis also provides an opportunity to analyze text as indicators of interactions between individuals, and thus as relevant data for understanding the relationship between members of a community or network.

When applying sentiment analysis to corporate e-mails, we can glimpse how individuals privately communicate within an organization, and to what degree their communication involves expressions of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. We can take the resulting sentiment score and explore the correlation between that score and various metadata, such as the features of the individuals involved - their rank within the company, their gender, to whom they are communicating, etc. In some cases, this metadata may already be part of the data collection, and in others we need to separately generate it based on what we know about the context that the data references.

In the following section, we’ll introduce you to the NLTK toolkit for sentiment analysis with Python, and also describe a potential process in which exploratory analysis leads to a very particular application of that tool to understand gendered communication within a corporate context.


## Sentiment Analysis with NLTK: Intra-textual analysis

The Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, is a Python library that adds analytical tools, lexicons, training corpus, and other data and methods to use. To complete the example below, you will need to install the following:

* Python 3 (ideally 3.6 or above) - [Download & install instructions from the Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* NLTK - [Download & install instructions from NLTK.org](http://www.nltk.org/install.html)
* pandas - [Download & install instructions from pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)

Sentiment analysis tools attempt to identify the sentiment expressed in words. [Vader](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html "Vader page in Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Documentation") (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a sentiment intensity module added to NLTK in 2014. Unlike other techniques that require training on related text before use, Vader is ready to go for analysis without any special setup. Vader is unique in that it makes fine-tuned distinctions between varying degrees of positivity and negative and words and features. For example, Vader scores "comfort" moderately positively and "euphoria" extremely positively. Vader also attempts to capture and score the type of lexical features common to informal text online, such as capitalizations, exclamation points, and emoticons, as shown in the table below:

{% include figure.html filename="vader_feature_detection.png" caption="Vader captures slight gradations in enthusiasm. (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014)" %}

Like any text analysis tool, Vader should be evaluated critically and in the context of the assumptions it makes about communication. Vader was developed in the mid-2010s primarily for microblogging and social media (especially Twitter). This context is likely much more informal than professional e-mail, and contains language and feature usage patterns that differ from 1999-2002 patterns. However, Vader was also developed as a strong general purpose sentiment analyzer, and the authors’ initial study shows it compares favorably against tools that have been trained for specific domains, use specialized lexicons, or resource-heavy machine learning techniques (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). Its sensitivity towards degrees of affect may be well-suited to describe the subtle displays of emotion within professional e-mail - as researchers, we may be especially interested in capturing the moments where emotion surfaces in otherwise formal text. However, sentiment analysis continues to struggle to capture complex sentiments like irony, sarcasm, and mockery, when the average reader would be able to make the distinction between the literal text and its intended meaning. 

Researchers should be hesitant to assume sentiment scores provide objective evidence of emotion. Instead, sentiment scores draw upon assumptions, models of communication, and temporal and cultural context to produce helpful indicators that can guide our inquiry. 

## Calculate Sentiment for a Paragraph

Consider the following passage:

>“Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process. I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible. I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute. I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.” 

This is the opening paragraph from January 2012 e-mail from Timothy Belden to Louise Kitchen and John Lavorato regarding the “Employment Contracts Deal”. Belden directed Enron’s Energy Services, and would later be convicted of conspiracy to drive up energy costs in California that led to a state-wide energy crisis. 

Despite the feeling of frustration and anxiety you may glean the paragraph as a whole, notice the ambivalence of the specific phrases within the pargraph. Some appear to express good faith efforts, e.g.  “not trying to ‘hold up’ the deal” and “genuinely trying.” And yet, there are even stronger negative statements about “getting frustrated", "I am afraid", and “this company… has screwed me and the people who work for me.” 

Here’s how we can calculate sentiment scores for this paragraph:

```
# first, we import the relevant modules from the NLTK library
import nltk.data
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from nltk import sentiment

# here we assign Vader to a manageable object name
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

#below is the passage of text. Note that in Python, using three apostrophes around a string of text allows us to use newlines and whitespace if needed

message_text = '''Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process. I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible. I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute. I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.'''

print(message_text)

# Calling the polarity_scores method on sid and passing in the message_text outputs a dictionary with negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores for the input text
ss = sid.polarity_scores(message_text)

# Here we sort and print the dictionary key-value pairs for the user to view in the terminal
for k in sorted(ss):
        print('{0}: {1}, '.format(k, ss[k]), end='')
```


*Output*
```
Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process. I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible. I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute. I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.
compound: -0.3804, neg: 0.093, neu: 0.836, pos: 0.071,
```

<div class="alert alert-warning"> Be careful to use three single quotes to wrap the message_text string above. If you use double quotes, the string will end early due to the quotation marks within the section (“hold up”)</div>

Vader collects and scores negative, neutral, and positive words and features (and accounts for factors like negation along the way). The "neg", "neu", and "pos" values describe the fraction of weighted scores that fall into each category. Vader also sums all weighted scores to calculate a "compound" value normalized between -1 and 1; this value attempts to describe the overall affect of the entire text from strongly negative (-1) to strongly positive (1).

In this case, the Vader analysis describes the passage as moderately negative (-0.3804). We can think of this value as estimating the overall impression of an average reader when considering the e-mail as a whole, despite some ambiguity and ambivalence along the way.

What does this imply, to you, about the way that sentiment might be expressed within a professional e-mail context? How would this presence of ambivalence impact the way you conduct your exploratory data analysis? 


## Determine Appropriate Scope for E-mail

When analyzed via the Vader sentiment analysis tool, text yields a set of positive, neutral, and negative scores, which are then aggregated and scaled as a ‘compound score.’ While this is helpful to know in theory, how can this method be applied to the data in the Enron example - namely, a collection of e-mail data and metadata? And what can this tell us about the emotions, relationships, and changes over time of employees at Enron?

In this section, we will introduce you to the process of selecting the scope of analysis for our sentiment analysis tool. Consider the following raw data belonging to an October 3rd, 2000 e-mail written written by Jeffrey Shankman, then President of Global Markets at Enron:
```

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  


The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  


Thanks.   Jeff
```

In the message text of the e-mail, Shankman outlines a corporate strategy for moving forward in what he perceives as an ambiguous geopolitical context. The message describes a number of difficult situations, as well as exapseration ("The morning meetings are not inspiring") and uncertainty ("I don't have a real feel for everyone's passion"). At the same time, Shankman outlines a set of action steps along with polite requests ("I'd like to ask...") and expressions of gratitude ("Thanks").

Before we proceed, take a minute to reflect on the message. How do you feel like a typical reader would describe this e-mail? Given what you now know about Vader, what ratio of positivity, negativity, and neutrality do you expect the sentiment analysis tool to find in the message? Finally, what do you think the compound score will suggest about the overall affect in the message?

As we discussed above, sentiment analysis does not provide an objective output so much as guiding indicators that reflect our choice and calibration of analytical tools. Perhaps the most important element of calibration is selecting the **scope** of the text being analyzed. In our case, we can determine the scope of analysis by deciding between analyzing the entire message as a single unit, or instead, breaking the message into smaller units like sentences and analyzing each sentence separately. 

First, let’s consider a *message-level approach*, in which we analyze the message as a single block: 

```
# Continue with the same code the previous section, but replace the message_text variable with the new e-mail text:

message_text = '''It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the  following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed  tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy (?), and no real weather anywhere in the world. I think it would be most prudent to play  the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively.

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for  everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask  John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  Thanks. Jeff'''
```

*Output*
```

Thanks. Jeff
compound: 0.889, neg: 0.096, neu: 0.765, pos: 0.14,
```
Here you can see that, when analyzing the e-mail as a whole, Vader returns values that suggest the message is mostly neural (neu: 0.765) but that more features appear to be positive (pos: 0.14) rather than negative (0.096). Vader computes an overall sentiment score of **0.889** for the message (on a scale of -1 to 1) which suggests a strongly positive affect for the message as a whole.

Did this meet your expectation? If not, why do you think Vader found more positive than negative features?

At the message-entity-level, there is no way to single out particularly positive or negative sentiments in the message. This loss of detail may be irrelevant, or it may be vital when conducting exploratory analysis. For instance, identifying negative sentences in otherwise congenial e-mails may be especially important when looking for emotional outbursts or abusive exchanges that may occur very infrequently, but reveal something essential about the nature of a relationship. If we want to capture this level of nuance, we need a method for moving from message-level to senitment-level analysis.

Fortunately, NLTK provides a collection of tools for breaking up text into smaller components. *Tokenizers* split up strings of text into smaller pieces like sentences. Some can even further break out a sentence into particular parts of speech, such as the noun participle, adjective, etc. In our case, we will use NLTK's *english.pickle* tokenizer to break up paragraphs into sentences.

To install english.pickle from NLTK, you can write and run this two-line Python script:

```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

You can now rewrite the sentiment analysis script to analyze each sentence separately:

```
# below is the sentiment analysis code rewritten for sentence-level analysis
# note the new module -- word_tokenize!
import nltk.data
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from nltk import sentiment
from nltk import word_tokenize

sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Assigning the “english.pickle” tokenizer to new object name. 

tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')

message_text = '''It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the  following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed  tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy (?), and no real weather anywhere in the world.

# The tokenize method breaks up the paragraph into a list of strings. In this example, note that the tokenizer is confused by the absence of spaces after periods and actually fails to break up sentences in two instances. How might you fix that?

sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(message_text)

# We add the additional step of iterating through the list of sentences and calculating and printing polarity scores for each one.

for sentence in sentences:
        print(sentence)
        ss = sid.polarity_scores(sentence)
        for k in sorted(ss):
                print('{0}: {1}, '.format(k, ss[k]), end='')
        print()

Here you’ll note a much more detailed picture of the sentiment in this e-mail. Vader successfully identifies moderate to strongly negative sentences in the e-mail, especially the leading description of crises. Sentence-level analysis allows you to identify specific sentences and topics at the extremes of sentiment, which may be helpful later.

But even at this level, Vader also runs into a number of errors. The sentence beginning with "The morning meetings are not inspiring" outputs a surprisingly positive score -- perhaps because of a misreading of the terms "passion" and "respect". Also note that the question mark at the beginning of the e-mail and the period of Mon near the end cause english.pickle tokenizer to mistakenly break up sentences. This is a constant risk from informal and complex punctuation in text.

What do you notice about the distribution of scores? How can you imagine collecting them in a manner that would help you better understand your data and its relationships to the research questions you care about? (Feel free to experiment with different kinds of text in the message_text variable!)


## Applying Sentiment Analysis to the Correspondence E-mail Corpus

<div class="alert alert-warning">
 For the following steps, you will need to download a local copy of the Enron e-mail corpus. For now, you can download [an archived version](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tgz "Direct link to .tgz archived file of complete Enron email corpus") from Carnegie Melon University. (~2 GB) I am working on creating a smaller .zip with a subset of the data to permanently host on PH that will be closer to 300-400MB.

Setting the scope of sentiment analysis helps us think through what is important about these e-mails -- is is the structure and dynamics within e-mails? Evidence of rare instances of extreme negativity (or positivity)? Or the overall emotional impression of the e-mail?

Let’s imagine that, as we move forward through the Enron e-mail corpus, we decide that we are not as interested in the textual elements of the e-mail just for their own sake, but rather as evidence of the relationships between individuals at Enron. We might begin wondering questions like: who is communicating frequently within the organization? What is the quality of their relationships like - in particular, how positively or negatively do they communicate with one another? And what particular aspects of those individuals - such as their gender, position within the organization, etc. - correlate with the positivity and negativity of those interactions?

Instead of getting bogged down with many overlapping questions, let's start with one: what type of relationships did CEO John Lavorato have with his employees? And in particular, with whom did he have extremely positive or extremely negative interactions?

If you stuck with the sentiment analysis approach of analyzing every single e-mail in isolation, you would simply get a very, very large list of sentiment scores – up to 600,000 if you analyzed every single e-mail! We need a method for organizing or structuring the data so that we can generate all of the sentiment scores all at once. Then, we need a way to use these scores to learn things about the particular e-mails that catch our interest - in this case, the ten most positive and ten most negative e-mail exchanges from Lavorato's sent folder.

*Data structuring* refers to any process that transforms raw data (what you might also think of as primary source data) into a format that makes it easier to view, explore, and analyze.  Programming Historian hosts a number of lessons that explore data structuring and cleaning processing, including using [OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine "Another lesson on Programming Historian called Cleaning Data with OpenRefine"): a free, open-source “power tool” for cleaning data. 

In this example, we’ll explore using the email and os modules (included in the standard Python libraries) and pandas library (a popular add-on toolkit) to load e-mail data and metadata into a table-like data structure called a *DataFrame*. This allows us to sort and view our corpus data much easier than its current format of 600,000+ text files arranged in a maze of e-mail folders. DataFrames will also allow us to apply sentiment analysis to our data in efficient and creative ways, as we'll explore in the following sections.

## Why Use pandas and DataFrames for Exploratory Analysis? 

pandas has emerged over the past several years as a popular open source library for exploratory data analysis in Python. pandas brings together a powerful collection of data structure types and data analytical tools in a single high-performance package.

Using pandas allows us to do several important things for exploratory data analysis:
* Translate loosely-structured or unstructured data (in this case, a collection of raw e-mail data organized into text files and folders) into a format that Python libraries can easily act upon
* View quick summaries of the data as a whole, including typical statistical outputs
* Write an analysis fucntion (such as sentiment analysis), apply it to the entire data set, and add the results to a table-like structure called a DataFrame

The Enron email corpus is structured as a series of username e-mail folders. Each user’s folder contains, in turn, a set of folders that correspond to folders in their e-mail account (such as inbox, sent, etc.) In these folders are the e-mails collected by investigators – or specifically, the ones that haven’t been subsequently redacted between 2001 and 2004 for containing social security numbers or other sensitive information. The raw e-mail files are the primary unit of data in our analysis.

Raw text and numerical data is sometimes formatted as a table (a large grid of rows and columns) and saved in a comma-separated value file. In the case of the Enron E-mail Dataset, however, the e-mail data is scattered across many files and folders, and each file confroms to in a somewhat outdated plain text e-mail format.

Before we even get into using pandas and DataFrames, we must develop a method of iterating through these directories and subdirectories and loading the data and metadata. Fortunately, we have two standard Python modules to help with this heavy lifting: *os* and *email*.

*os* lets us call functions that will move through a series of folders and files and load them into memory. Python needs a module like this one in order to access the files on your computer. It’s important to be careful using os, especially with any functionality that would move or delete files!!

*email* lets us quickly load e-mail message data and metadata into memory. In many cases, raw digital data may be formatted into *comma-separated values (.csv)* files that clearly define rows and columns, such as "'sender@gmail.com', 'recipient@gmail.com', 'Message'". In other cases, like this one, the data is structured in an outdated format like "From: sender@gmail.com (newline) To: recipient@gmail.com (newline) Message: MESSAGE"
 
Fortunately, even though this nonstandard format is not recognized by the csv module in Python, the *email* module understands the formatting and lets us access the data as a dictionary in Python with keys like 'From' and 'To'. 

Below is the code in greater detail and its output:

Succes! We have transformed the corpus e-mail data into a single new data structure called a DataFrame. The *df.head(10)* method we calld outputs a tidy table summary of the first 10 rows of the DataFrame we created called *df*. Remember that a DataFrame behaves much like a matrix or spreadsheet in that it conceputalizes each data entity as a row consisting of several standard columns. 

Feel free to play with the output settings in Pandas to see more of Lavorato’s sent email box as a giant DataFrame.

## Writing and mapping a Sentiment Analysis function to the DataFrame

At this point, you may be thinking “okay, great, a giant table! But why are we using the pandas library when I could just print the e-mails directly from email_list, use other data structures like lists or dictionaries, or even load them into an Excel spreadsheet?”

The crucial aspect of a DataFrame for our purposes is its ability to calculate new columns based on functions that we've written. We can apply our NLP analytical techniques en masse to every e-mail in the Corpus (represented as a row). This technique allows us to move from applying Sentiment Analysis to a single e-mail to many thousands of e-mails, and then to sort the results in some fashion to fetch the most exemplary examples. 

Let’s continue our investigation into the 10 most positive and 10 most negative e-mails that Lavorato has sent off to others. We can bring the Sentiment Analysis code in from the previous example and package it into a function called *mapMessageSentiment*. Our mapping function is almost identical to that earlier code, except for how it handles input and output. Input is passed into the function via a single string variable called *message* (this will make it easy for pandas to understand how to interact with the function). 

Output is a little more complicated. We have to find a way to pass along the four components of our sentiment analysis results:  *compound*, *positive*, *neutral*, and *negative* outputs generated by the Vader SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() module. In Python, a *tuple* is a data structure in which multiple items are combined into a single entity, like this: (item a, item b, item c, so on...). As with the input that took a single string variable, outputting this single tuple variable helps pandas to understand what to do with the output -- in this case, place it into a new column that we've created for our DataFrame called *Sentiment*.

But in this example, we still want to be able to look at each result of our sentiment analysis independently (what if, later on, we only want to look at Positive values, or only the Compound value, for example?) To make life easier for us, we can *unpack* the Sentiment tuple, which means take the four-part single tuple variable and place each value into four separate new variables. Unpacking, which we accomplish via the .apply(pd.Series) method, allows us to generate four new columns: *CompoundSentiment*, *PositiveSentiment*, *NeutralSentiment*, and *NegativeSentiment*.

Finally, pandas DataFrames support sorting much like typical lists in Python. We will immediately take advantage of the new rows we generated for each sentiment score type and sort the entire DataFrame by CompoundSentiment values in descending order. The DataFrame method *sort_values()* takes the name of the column to sort on and a value for ascending. We can then print key information on the five e-mails with the highest *CompoundSentiment* values using the *head()* method. Then, we can repeat this same approach but with *ascending* set to True to print information about the top five most negative e-mails.

        for sentence in sentences:
                ss = sid.polarity_scores(sentence)
                sum_compound += ss['compound']
                sum_pos += ss['pos']
                sum_neu += ss['neu']
                sum_neg += ss['neg']


        return (sum_compound / num_sentences), (sum_pos / num_sentences), (sum_neu / num_sentences), (sum_neg / num_sentences)


df['Sentiment'] = df.Message.apply(mapMessageSentiment)
df[['CompoundSentiment', 'PositiveSentiment', 'NeutralSentiment', 'NegativeSentiment']] = df['Sentiment'].apply(pd.Series)

<div class="alert alert-warning"> Remember to modify the ‘path’ variable with your system’s location information</div>

Using this technique, we discover a curious set of e-mails. On the positive end, Lavorato expresses a “strong yes” in one message, gratitude in most, and praises the work of two employees: Bob Schorr and Mark Tawney. On the negative end, Vader Lavorato criticizes mistakes, including unauthorized salary changes by a subordinate, and makes the foreboding statement “The pain will stop soon” in an email with the subject line “Re: 12/13 Loss Notification.” 

Vader appears to pick up a couple of false positives in the negative e-mails. However, the majority of e-mails (8/10) capture the sentiment of e-mails as the casual reader would interpret them. 

At this point, we have developed a technique for identifying the emotional extremes of e-mails sent by a particular individual (you can go ahead and replace “lavorato-j” with any of the other 130+ subdirectory names in maildir). For a researcher interested in understanding how specific individuals communicated in the midst of the Enron collapse, this might provide a valuable jumping-off point to conduct a deep dive into those moments of conflict and intensity – or perhaps an investigation into positive, possible collusive relationships!


# Part 2: Analyzing Relationships Across a Corresopndence Network


## Sentiment Analysis Across a Network

Imagine that, at this point, you decide that you are indeed interested in the relationships between individuals in the organization. But instead of beginning with a single individual, you would instead like the analysis to identify especially positive or negative relationships across the entire Corpus. You may be interested in identifying the extremes of conflict or collaboration (or collusion?) at Enron, but you don’t know where to start.

For this segment, we will move from conceptualizing e-mail corpus data as rows within a single table, and instead as lines of communication across a *network* of individuals. In this case, every individual within the organization is represented by a single *node*. E-mails show interactions between individuals or nodes within the network - in network theory, these are called *edges*, or lines that connect a *source node* to a *target node*.

We can continue using the same tools as before to load in our data and metadata, place it into a DataFrame, and apply Sentiment Analysis and map the results to new columns. However, we want to introduce a few new constraints to the e-mails to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in our data:

* Instead of searching for e-mails within a specific subfolder, look at the e-mails in the “sent” folder of every individual in the corpus. This helps us decrease the amount of time it will take to process the e-mails, while also ensuring that these e-mails represent meaningful communication between individuals (as opposed to spam, forwarded jokes (very common in 1999-2001), company-wide announcements, etc.)
* Only include e-mails with a single sender and single recipient. This helps us make sure the e-mail is expressing something about a relationship between two individuals.
* Only include e-mails where the recipient e-mail ends in @enron.com and appears as a sender elsewhere in the corpus (e.g. is one of the ~130 Enron employees included in the Corpus)

In this technique, we first create a list of all possible sender-recipient pairs in the DataFrame. At this stage, we apply a few further constraints to make sure we are capturing substantial relationships:

* Only include relationships that include at least two e-mails. This excludes one-off e-mail exchanges and ensures there is at least some degree of relationship between these two individuals. (You can play with this condition if you wish, which appears as: “if network_dict_count[pair] > 1”) 
* Keep sender and recipient pairs directional, meaning that the e-mails A sends to B are aggregated separately than the emails B sends to A. Sometimes there is no need to differentiate between the direction of interactions in a relationship. In this case, however, we want to be able to separately consider how an executive communicates with a subordinate and how that same subordinate communicates with the executive -- the styles may be very different. We'll be able to specifically look at how individuals behave when they send e-mails to people with certain qualities within the organization. 

To start, we need to come up with a method for listing out every possible sender-recipient pair that meets our minimum threshhold of two e-mails exchanged. We can generate a new 'Pair' column from the pre-existing 'From' and 'To' columns (this is very similar to the way we created four Positive/Neutral/Negative/Compound columns from the single Sentiment score tuple). We can then iterate through our DataFrame to count up the number of e-mails that match each To-From pair, and store this value in a dictionary called *network_dict_count*. For this dictionary, the keys will have the name of the Pair (such as 'john.lavorato@enron.com,chris.gaskill@enron.com') and the value will be the count of e-mails (for example, 4). This will help us make sure later on that we're only dealing with pairs that have at least two e-mails in all of the Sent folders in the corpus.

As we count up the number of e-mails for each Pair, we can also collect all of the sentiment scores from e-mails associated with that To-From Pair (remember, these are directional relationships, so the order of To and From matters to us). We can create a second dictionary called *network_dict_sentiments* to store this information. Again, each key in the dictionary will be a Pair ('john.lavorato@enron.com,chris.gaskill@enron.com') but each value will be the sum of the CompoundSentiment scores in all of the associated e-mails (such as 0.6). Later on, we can divide the sum of these scores to the number of scores to find the average score! But keep in mind that, if you are interested in a different metric (such as the distribution of scores) you would probably want to store each score in this variable individually, such as in a long list of scores, as opposed to simply storing their sum. However, for us, this will work well.

Now that we have the sum and the average for each pair, we can create a new dictionary called *average_sentiment*. Again, our key will be the Pair of To-From e-mail addresses, and the value will be the sum of Compound Sentiment scores divide by the number of Compound Sentiment scores. Here, you can see the value of using that same 'Pair' key name across all of those dictionaries! We can run through every possible Pair and pull values from each dictionary by using that Pair key name.

Here we’ve been able to identify specific relationships at either extreme of sentiment expressed. Positivity appears more likely to appear in exchanges with just a few e-mails, whereas the most negative relationships include ones with substantial e-mail back-and-forth. (Note that Lavorato and Shankman appear in several relationships at either extreme.)

Again, we find a jumping-off point for further analysis which may or may not continue to use natural language processing techniques like Sentiment Analysis. You can imagine exploratory data analysis in this instance as providing the justification and framework for subsequent analysis, and doing so in a powerful, computational manner. 


## Exploring Correlations Between Sentiment and Other Features Across the Network

Let’s imagine that the data exploration so far has stoked your interest in the qualities of relationships as expressed through substantial e-mail exchanges. But instead of leading you to particular relationships that represent extremes within the organization, you’d like to explore what those sentiment scores might tell you about particular subsets of the network. In this case, your interest diverges from particular pairs of individuals and focuses instead on the relationship between the characteristics of employees and how they speak to one another. As with the prior shift from analyzing specific texts to seeing texts as indicative of particular relationships, we now want to shift from analyzing specific relationships to seeing them as indicative of trends within the organization as a whole.

To accomplish this, we must include a method for associating the individual nodes in the network with properties of interest. A number of studies of the Enron e-mail corpus have included in their pre-processing individual metadata such as professional title, job category within the company (i.e. trader, manager, CEO), gender, and more.

To begin: How do the genders of the sender and recipient of e-mails relate to the sentiment expressed in their exchanges?

For the purposes of this tutorial, we followed the methodology of similar studies and generated a dictionary that attempts to correlate every e-mail address with a gender. Please note that this is only an approximation of gender identity based upon first name and, when available, additional publicly accessible documentation. Whenever possible, we included a ‘M’ for man and ‘W’ for woman. In instances where gender was indeterminable, we simply included a ‘?’. This allows us to still proceed with gender analysis while acknowledging the limitations of external/de-facto identifying processes, and that individuals may have non-conforming names, nonbinary or transgender identities not reflected in legal names, etc. Further, the use of ‘men’ and ‘women’ as opposed to ‘male’ and ‘female’ reflects our interest in gender identity rather than sex.

We recommend that you create a *module* that you can later import into your main Python script. To create a module, simply create a new file in the same directory as your other files called *gender_module.py*. Then, create a dictionary by copying and pasting the following text:
```
possible_gender = {'ina.rangel@enron.com': 'W', 'phillip.allen@enron.com': 'M', 'john.arnold@enron.com': 'M', 'harry.arora@enron.com': 'M', 'eric.bass@enron.com': 'M', 'sally.beck@enron.com': 'W', 'patti.thompson@enron.com': 'W', 'gretel.smith@enron.com': 'W', 'robert.benson@enron.com': 'M', 'sandra.brawner@enron.com': 'W', 'rick.buy@enron.com': 'M', 'larry.campbell@enron.com': 'M', 'mike.carson@enron.com': 'M', 'michelle.cash@enron.com': 'W', 'twanda.sweet@enron.com': 'W', 'martin.cuilla@enron.com': 'M', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com': 'M', 'joseph.alamo@enron.com': 'M', 'dana.davis@enron.com': '?', 'clint.dean@enron.com': 'M', 'david.delainey@enron.com': 'M', 'kay.chapman@enron.com': '?', 'beverly.stephens@enron.com': 'W', 'james.derrick@enron.com': 'M', 'stacy.dickson@enron.com': 'W', 'tom.donohoe@enron.com': 'M', 'chris.dorland@enron.com': '?', 'frank.ermis@enron.com': 'M', 'daren.farmer@enron.com': 'M', 'mary.fischer@enron.com': 'W', 'mark.fisher@enron.com': 'M', 'drew.fossum@enron.com': 'M', 'martha.benner@enron.com': 'W', 'rob.gay@enron.com': 'M', 'randall.gay@enron.com': 'M', 'chris.germany@enron.com': 'M', 'darron.giron@enron.com': '?', 'mike.grigsby@enron.com': 'M', 'mark.haedicke@enron.com': 'M', 'sylvia.sauseda@enron.com': 'W', 'janette.elbertson@enron.com': 'W', 'carol.kincannon@enron.com': 'W', 'rod.hayslett@enron.com': 'M', 'marie.heard@enron.com': 'W', 'judy.hernandez@enron.com': 'W', 'juan.hernandez@enron.com': 'M', 'jeffrey.hodge@enron.com': 'M', 'jenny.helton@enron.com': 'W', 'stanley.horton@enron.com': 'M', 'cindy.stark@enron.com': 'W', 'dan.hyvl@enron.com': 'M', 'tana.jones@enron.com': '?', 'vince.kaminski@enron.com': 'M', 'steven.kean@enron.com': 'M', 'maureen.mcvicker@enron.com': 'W', 'peter.keavey@enron.com': 'M', 'jeff.king@enron.com': 'M', 'tori.kuykendall@enron.com': 'W', 'angela.mcculloch@enron.com': 'W', 'john.lavorato@enron.com': 'M', 'kimberly.hillis@enron.com': '?', 'rosalee.fleming@enron.com': 'W', 'tori.wells@enron.com': 'W', 'kenneth.lay@enron.com': 'M', 'matthew.lenhart@enron.com': 'M', 'andrew.lewis@enron.com': 'M', 'michelle.lokay@enron.com': 'W', 'phillip.love@enron.com': 'M', 'mike.maggi@enron.com': 'M', 'kay.mann@enron.com': 'W', 'larry.may@enron.com': 'M', 'mike.mcconnell@enron.com': 'M', 'cathy.phillips@enron.com': 'W', 'brad.mckay@enron.com': 'M', 'errol.mclaughlin@enron.com': 'M', 'patrice.mims@enron.com': 'W', 'scott.neal@enron.com': 'M', 'kimberly.brown@enron.com': 'W', 'gerald.nemec@enron.com': 'M', 'susan.pereira@enron.com': 'W', 'debra.perlingiere@enron.com': 'W', 'kevin.presto@enron.com': 'M', 'joe.quenet@enron.com': 'M', 'bill.rapp@enron.com': 'M', 'andrea.ring@enron.com': 'W', 'robin.rodrigue@enron.com': '?', 'benjamin.rogers@enron.com': 'M', 'kevin.ruscitti@enron.com': 'M', 'elizabeth.sager@enron.com': 'W', 'brenda.whitehead@enron.com': 'W', 'richard.sanders@enron.com': 'M', 'diana.scholtes@enron.com': 'W', 'susan.scott@enron.com': 'W', 'kaye.ellis@enron.com': 'W', 'sara.shackleton@enron.com': 'W', 'jeffrey.shankman@enron.com': 'M', 'richard.shapiro@enron.com': 'M', 'hunter.shively@enron.com': 'M', 'katherine.brown@enron.com': 'W', 'sherri.sera@enron.com': 'W', 'jeff.skilling@enron.com': 'M', 'sherri.reinartz@enron.com': 'W', 'joannie.williamson@enron.com': 'W', 'matt.smith@enron.com': 'M', 'steven.south@enron.com': 'M', 'carol.clair@enron.com': 'W', 'chris.stokley@enron.com': '?', 'paige.grumulaitis@enron.com': 'W', 'fletcher.sturm@enron.com': 'M', 'tamara.black@enron.com': 'W', 'kate.symes@enron.com': 'W', 'mark.taylor@enron.com': 'M', 'jane.tholt@enron.com': 'W', 'judy.townsend@enron.com': 'W', 'barry.tycholiz@enron.com': 'M', 'v.weldon@enron.com': 'M', 'greg.whalley@enron.com': 'M', 'liz.taylor@enron.com': 'W', "paul.y'barbo@enron.com": 'M'}
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">Triple-clicking allows you to select the entire, very long line of text</div>

Now, returning to your main Python file, add a line after your dependencies to import the dictionary:

```
from gender_module import possible_gender
```

As with our previous network generation technique, we will again aggregate scores based upon four possible relationships: Women->Women, Women->Men, Men->Women, and Men->Men. 

In this script, *pair* references our previously established master list of all possible sender->recipient pairings, represented as a tuple. We can unpack the tuple into sender and recipient strings, and call the possible_gender dictionary with the sender and recipient strings as keys. If the keys are part of the dictionary, the call will return a value of either ‘M’, ‘W’, or ‘?’. The if-then logic is written in such a way that no action will be taken if either of the keys return a ‘?’

Note that the if-then loops are wrapped within a try:/except: pattern. If Python attempts to access a key that doesn’t exist, it will result in a KeyError exception will stop the program. While the *.get* method provides a safe alternative for handling keys that may or may not exist within a dictionary (for instance, possible_gender.get(‘lalala’) would return None), the try/except loop has the benefit of notifying us in the console if a problem occurs, which we may want to investigate later.


```

        sender, recipient = pair.split(',')
        try:

                        if possible_gender[recipient] == 'W':
                                WW_scores.append(average_sentiment[pair])

```
The exploratory analysis appears to point us to a substantial difference between sentiment across genders. Women communicating with other women express, on average, a 50% higher sentiment score than men, whereas communication between individuals of the two genders hover somewhere in between. 

This finding is promising, but it's important to note it does not itself provide evidence of a statistically significant difference. We've made no attempt to calculate confidence intervals or conceptualize the data within a statistical model. Instead, the exploratory analysis provides exactly the kind of detective's clue that Tukey (1977) argues should compel us to judicate with confirmatory analysis. This might look like an attempt to demonstrate a statstically significant correlation between genders of correspondents and sentiment score, or perhaps a close reading textual analysis of a subset of e-mails, or even an qualitative study of workplace culture at Enron during the crisis years.

We also might be compelled to shape and further refine our researcher questions via subsequent exploratory analysis. How might those changes in sentiment by gender further change over the course of Enron’s collapse? How about when communication is with a superior, a subordinate, or a peer within the corporate hierarchy? What about exploring correlations for entirely different characteristics of individuals? The possibilities may not be infinite, but they are certainly vast.

## Where Can We Take Exploratory Data Analysis From Here?

In the sections above, we have explored how the process of writing and implementing code for data analysis can go hand-in-hand with a process of discernment and investigation for a researcher. While our code developed into a longer and more complex application along the way, there is not a single endpoint or outcome with more intrinsic value than the others. Rather, there are a number of hopping-off points where you as a researcher may consider hopping off and switching to other forms of analysis.

At the same time, you may wish to continue exploring this data and applying further analytical techniques, such as graphing possible correlations. Another axis of analysis you may consider is going further into the toolkit of *network analysis*. In particular, the earlier model of nodes and edges, when saved to a .csv file, can form the basis of network generation and calculation of features like betweenness-centrality, community detection, and more. 

As one final example, here is a sneak peak of what that might look like to generate a network graph to explore the patterns of communication between individuals and communities (or “neighborhoods”) within an organization:

{% include figure.html filename="enron_network_with_communities.png" caption="Network graph with communities generated with NetworkX" %}


The larger font sizes for individuals indicates their betweenness-centrality in the network, or the degree to which individuals are likely to be linked through them. (Incidentally, that figure also appears to correlate with the likelihood of being charged with a felony in the Enron scandal.)

Though this technique falls outside of the scope of this particular e-mail, you can continue on to the NetworkX lesson on Programming Historian to do just that! You will need a .csv file version of the network data to generate the network graph. To grab this, simply add the following code to our example above to generate a list of edges (one for each e-mail between individuals in a pair) and save it to a csv file:

```
#... adds the following code to the section above 


fout3 = open('edges_for_network.csv', 'w')
for pair in sorted_pairs:
        sender, recipient = pair.split(',')
        for x in range (0, network_dict_count[pair]):
                fout3.write('"' + sender + '","' + recipient + '", ' + str(average_sentiment[pair]) + '\n')
fout3.close()
```
To learn the techniques to go from edges and nodes to a complete network graph, continue on to the NetworkX tutorial here (note: add link to PH lesson).

Regardless of where you choose to jump off the exploratory process, hopefully this lesson provides you with a working sense of what types of questions exploratory data analysis can help answer, and how it can support your research process. Computational techniques are exciting and sometimes flashy, but they do not require us to set aside our research questions, our skepticisms, or our critical thought process. We do our best research when we weave methodologies and analytical processes together in pursuit of whatever inspires our curiosity. Hopefully this gives you a roadmap for doing just that with Python, NLTK, and pandas.
